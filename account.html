    <h1>How To Add An Account</h1>

<div>
 <p>Some people can actually add a personal account to websites like Gmail or YouTube even when their Chrome policies prevent adding personal accounts to the actual computer or browser.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>1.First, you'll have to break the connection between your Chromebook and Chrome.
  This can be done by going to https://myaccount.google.com/device-activity with your school account on another device, then finding your Chromebook on that page and clicking the sign out button, or by going to chrome://settings/signOut (if you can, do them both as it will increase your chances of this working)
</p>
</div>
  <div>
    <p>
      3.Then, you have to clear your cookies and site data from google.com, and all other google related domains.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>4.Finally, go to this link to add an account (you can even do this multiple times)

.........Note that this will not work for everybody (you may get a "this account is not allowed to sign in within your network" error) and you'll have to repeat the steps every time you sign out and back into your computer.</p>
